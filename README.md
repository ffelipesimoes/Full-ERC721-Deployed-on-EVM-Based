<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of a full ERC721 contract on an EVM-based blockchain. It includes the necessary files and instructions to deploy the contract and interact with it.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- Hardhat - A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- Solidity - A programming language for writing smart contracts.
- TypeScript - A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- Ethers.js - A library for interacting with Ethereum.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node.js package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ffelipesimoes/Full-ERC721-Deployed-on-EVM-Based.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Full-ERC721-Deployed-on-EVM-Based
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Deployment

1. Configure your network settings in the `hardhat.config.js` file, including the network URL and account mnemonic.

2. Run the following command to compile the contracts:

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

3. Run the deployment script to deploy the ERC721 contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run --network <NETWORK_NAME> scripts/deploy-contract.ts
```

Replace `<NETWORK_NAME>` with the name of the network you want to deploy to (e.g., `sepolia`, `mumbai`, or `mainnet`).

4. Take note of the deployed contract address displayed in the console.

### Interacting with the Contract

1. Create the `contractAddress` variable in the `.env` file with the deployed contract address.

2. Run the following command to mint a new NFT:

```sh
npx hardhat run --network <NETWORK_NAME> scripts/mint-nft.ts
```

Replace `<NETWORK_NAME>` with the name of the network you deployed to.

This script will mint a new NFT with a unique token ID and assign it to the specified recipient address.
